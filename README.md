# GeneSynth

GeneSynth is a Python-based software designed for Assembly PCR oligo design. The application features a user-friendly and minimalist interface.

GeneSynth efficiently divides the target sequence into overlapping oligos, considering melting temperatures and hairpin formation.

This tool proved instrumental in saving substantial time for myself and my colleagues when designing oligos for Assembly PCR, a technique that was frequently employed in the laboratory
